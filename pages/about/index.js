              Hi my name is Emily Perryman, I like to go by Em. I help
              individuals lose weight and prevent or reverse chronic diseases in
              a sustainable and enjoyable manner by teaching the power of
              cultivating healthy habits related to eating more plants and
              embracing healthy lifestyle practices.

                    I have an immense passion for helping guide others toward a
                    more healthful and vibrant life. This passion has led me to
                    pursue a career as a Registered Dietitian, to obtain a
                    Masters Degree in Nutrition, and to learn as much as I can
                    about balanced nutrition and healthy lifestyle practices.{" "}

                  <p>
                    Early in my career as a Dietitian at several nursing homes
                    in Baltimore City, I witnessed what seemed like immense
                    suffering and reduced quality of life in men and women, some
                    as young as myself at the time (late 20s) due to
                    debilitating diseases like stroke, Type 2 Diabetes, kidney
                    failure, and others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I felt at a loss of how to help them which led me to want to
                    find a way to help prevent others from suffering this same
                    fate. Finding a way to help empower, educate, and support
                    individuals on their journeys to achieving optimal health
                    became my passion and something I feel so grateful to be
                    able to do!

                    I believe that all individuals have the right to live a full
                    and vibrant life. I feel that the foundation for living our
                    best lives is our health. Though our genes play a role in
                    our health, their role is small compared to the role that
                    healthful lifestyle practices have on our physical and
                    mental wellbeing.{" "}

                    Healthy lifestyle practices that have a positive impact on

                    denote them as SPARC to help us ignite these practices in
